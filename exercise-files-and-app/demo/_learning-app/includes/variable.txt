A variable must start with a dollar ($) sign, followed by the variable name.
It can only contain alpha-numeric character and underscore (A-z, 0-9, _).
A variable name must start with a letter or underscore (_) character.
A PHP variable name cannot contain spaces.
One thing to be kept in mind that the variable name cannot start with a number or special symbols.
PHP variables are case-sensitive, so $name and $NAME both are treated as different variable.
