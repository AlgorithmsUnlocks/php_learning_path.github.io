The default is an optional statement. Even if it is not important, that default must always be the last statement.
There can be only one default in a switch statement. More than one default may lead to a Fatal error.
Each case can have a break statement, which is used to terminate the sequence of statements.
The break statement is optional to use in switch. If break is not used, all the statements will execute after finding a matched case value.
PHP allows you to use number, character, string, as well as functions in switch expressions.
Nesting of switch statements is allowed, but it makes the program more complex and less readable.
You can use semicolon (;) instead of colon (:). It will not generate any errors.
